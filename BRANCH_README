Specific information about the purpose of this branch compared to the master 
branch.

Contains code to generate a similarity matrix for the HMMs themselves. 
Pronunciations are then generated by mapping the original HMMs to the new
clusters. Original experiments did not work well. Likely need a better method 
for generating similarities between HMMs.
